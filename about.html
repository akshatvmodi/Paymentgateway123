                   Those who give to charity are also participating in a cause that is larger and more significant than themselves. People don’t need to participate in volunteerism to give back – giving to a charitable cause is an equally significant way in helping an organisation make a difference and provide aid to the needy. Further, studies have shown that those who give to charity find themselves experiencing an overall improved sense of happiness.
                   Even the smallest of donations can make a big impact. NGOs like Save the Children have highly cost-efficient programs, which are able to channelise the value of every single rupee towards helping the marginalised and impoverished across India. While India has seen rising incomes, this has also been matched with rising income inequality. In such times, making a difference enables people to feel a mutual sense of hope, fulfilment, and purpose.
